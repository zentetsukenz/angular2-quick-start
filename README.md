## Acknowledgement

This Angular2 quick start is based on the lovely guide, Angular2 5 minutes quick start, by Google's Angular core team.

## Development environment

Mac OSX 10.11 Yosemite is used to build this Angular2 quick start.

## Preparation

There are things you may need before you can build and run Angular2 app. These tools may be useful.

* [NVM](#nvm)
* [NPM](#npm)
* [Editor](#editor)

### NVM

Using NVM (Node Package Manager) helps you manage your Node version with ease.

To install or update NVM please follow [official NVM repository](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) guideline.

### NPM

By default, after you install Node, NPM will also be installed along with it.

You should install NPM latest version, right now is v3.3.9. As it provides better interactive than the old version 2.

To install or update NPM, please follow [updating NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

### Editor

Please use your favorite editor or IDE. But I would like to present a SublimeText 3 with TypeScript plugin by Microsoft.

There are many features that you will gain by using TypeScript plugin. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TDUV9R09PM), you can watch for its new features.

You can find SublimeText 3 installer from their [website](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) (It's still in beta but I think it better than version 2).

Then install SublimeText 3 [package control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

And finally use package controll to install TypeScript, by pressing `cmd+shift+p` in Mac, then type `install package`, enter. And finally `TypeScript` to install.
